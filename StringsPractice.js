// Practice 1
// let str = "Please give me Rs 1000"
// let amount = Number.parseInt(str.slice(18)) //Cauz it would be string elsewhere
// console.log(amount)
// console.log(typeof amount)

// Practice 2

let str = "Were you able to do it"
console.log(str[4]) // Strings are immutable and therefore they cannot be changed
